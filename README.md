# Melanoma-identification--FYP
Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in the world. Melanoma is the most fatal form of skin cancer and accounts for the majority of annual fatalities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the US, there will likely be 7,650 melanoma deaths in 2022, with an anticipated 99,780 new cases. To avoid adverse results from the advent, prompt detection and treatment are required. It is primarily recognized and distinguished by expensive and difficult malignant skin development. Therefore, using computer-aided techniques to assist with an initial diagnosis will enable marginalised populations to get the service at a lower cost. Despite the fact that some research has concentrated on using various machine learning algorithms to categorise, most of them lack the generalizability of their solution to be employed in a practical situation.
 
Also, automated melanoma detection using digitised dermo copy pictures provides a significant potential use for deep learning techniques. Deep neural networks (DNNs), which can tackle complicated problems, are becoming more and more common in medical applications. However, because the algorithms' decision-making is basically a black-box process, it is challenging for doctors to assess the decisions' dependability. In order to solve this issue, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is frequently proposed.
 
There are 2 main types of automated skin cancer classification methods used in the modern world,
CNN (Convolution Neural Network) based methods with explainability
ViT (Vision Transformer) based methods with explainability
 
Therefore, as per the project proposal, this research project is mainly focusing on both CNN-based and ViT-based automated skin cancer classification. The next sections of this progress report cover the problem statement, project objectives, related literature associated with the research, methodology and product design, proposed solution, current progress, problems encountered, and future working areas of the project.
